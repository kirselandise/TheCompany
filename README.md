### Final Project submitted by Trinity McCann

# Overview
### Setting
Welcome to my final project. This text based adventure game is highly inspired by sci fi video game, Lethal Company. You find yourself stuck in the SS5126 that has been compromised. Escape and leave before the monsters can get to you. 
### Locations and Items
There are many locations and four items in total. The ones of note are: 
Entrance Room (where you start)
Escape Pods (Where you leave)
Laser Blaster (Found in the Central Cooridor (oh no, who didn't make it out))
Data Core 1 (found in the Storage Bay)
Data Core 2 (found in the Captains' Quarters)
Data Core 3 (found in Communications)
### Goal State
You need to retrieve all three data cores and drop them at the escape pods to leave. 
### Future Goals
If I were to further expand this game, I would add monsters that you can run into if you are taking to long. The laser blaster would have three chargers allowing you to defend yourself three times before its game over.

### Final Thoughts
Really enjoyed this project even though I despise racket. If I had the choice, I would never touch this language again in my life lol. I appreciate the fun final though
